# Family Finance Manager

You can observe and manage daily expenses with this web app, which is based on JavaScript, JQuery, PHP and XML.

(I know these looks outdated but anyway it's a good start at that time...)

It provides stuffs like:

* Adding a new record
* Customizing your records
* Seaching for a record / records
* Removing a record / records

May rewrite with nodejs.
